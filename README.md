#ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Analyzer

A Java Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to build a real-time stock price analyzer using:

âœ… Apache Kafka â€“ for event streaming

âœ… Kafka Streams â€“ for time-windowed aggregations (avg price, volume, VWAP)

âœ… PostgreSQL/MySQL â€“ to persist raw ticks & aggregates

âœ… Redis â€“ for caching latest ticks for fast reads

âœ… WebSockets (STOMP/SockJS) â€“ to push live updates to browser clients

âœ… Docker Compose â€“ to run Kafka, Zookeeper, Postgres, and Redis easily in dev

ðŸš€ Features

Ingest real-time stock price ticks into Kafka

Persist raw tick data in Postgres for analytics

Compute 1-min, 5-min moving averages, VWAP, volume sums via Kafka Streams

Store recent prices in Redis for low-latency queries

Push live ticks & aggregates to clients using WebSockets

Provide REST APIs to fetch historical and aggregated data
